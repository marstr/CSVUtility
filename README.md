# CSV Utilities

Have you written a simple CSV parser too many times in your life, in too many separate projects? Have you been bitten too many times before by having a rogue comma show up in a column of your data?

Look no further than this CSV package. It was built to mitigate the problems that you have run into above.

## Get started with CSVUtilites
 1. Add \\clrstoredata\Common as a NuGet source in Visual Studio
 2. Add CSVUtilities to your project.
 3. Enjoy the tools provided, and the XML comments that tell you what is going on.
